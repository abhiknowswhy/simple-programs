# simple-programs

This repo is for some simple projects and implementations for miscellaneous concepts that I try out:
1. [Calculator in c](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/simple-programs/tree/main/calculator%20in%20c) - to understand how makefiles work
2. [Bloom Filter in python](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/simple-programs/tree/main/Bloom%20filters) - simple bloom filter using `mmh3` library for hash generation
3. [QR Code generator](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/simple-programs/tree/main/QR%20code%20generator) - generating QR code using `qrcode` python library
4. [Todo web app](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/simple-programs/tree/main/TodoWebApp) - a simple react app for maintaining a to do list
5. [Merkle trees](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/simple-programs/tree/main/Merkle%20trees) - WIP
6. [Event keycodes](https://github.com/abhiknowswhy/simple-programs/tree/main/event-keycodes) - a simple vanilla JS app which displays key code and details for a button on keyboard
